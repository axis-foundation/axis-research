# Axis (Draft)
### A human–AI co-designed logic language experiment

Axis is an experiment in co-designing a logic language with an AI partner, exploring what emerges when humans guide semantics and intent while AI explores structure and patterns.

Most programming languages—functional, imperative, or logic—are shaped around human intuition. Axis asks a different question:

> **What does a programming language look like when an AI participates directly in its design as a collaborator rather than a tool?**

Axis is small, declarative, and designed with an emphasis on simple semantics, determinism, and clarity. The goal is to create a language that is understandable to humans but not centered exclusively on human cognitive preferences—one that feels natural for an AI system to reason about.

## 🌱 Design Approach

The project follows a collaborative process where:

**The human role** is to  
- define intent  
- enforce constraints  
- shape semantics  
- refine and clarify  
- push for coherence and rigor  

**The AI role** is to  
- propose structures  
- generate variations  
- explore alternative semantics  
- surface non-human patterns  
- iterate at high speed  

Axis is the structure that emerged where these two reasoning styles overlap.

## 📘 Specification

The draft language specification (v0.4.1) can be found here:

➡️ **[`spec/axis-language-v0.4.1.md`](https://github.com/christaylor98/axis/blob/main/spec/axis-language-0.4.1.md)**

It includes:
- syntax  
- expression forms  
- types  
- evaluation model  
- examples  
- design rationale  

This is exploratory work; everything is open to critique and revision.

## 🧪 Status

Axis is **early research**, not a finished language.  
The focus at this stage is on the clarity, coherence, and usefulness of the core semantics.

Feedback and discussion are welcome — especially from those with experience in:

- logic languages  
- PL design  
- verification and proof systems  
- AI reasoning  
- semantics and type theory

## 🤝 Feedback

If you have comments, ideas, or critique, please open an issue or start a discussion.  
Thoughtful feedback at this stage is far more valuable than implementation work.
