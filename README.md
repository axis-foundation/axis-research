⚠️ Status: Architectural Archive

This repository reflects an earlier research framing of Axis, with a strong emphasis on AI-driven systems.

Since then, Axis has evolved into a semantics-first language and compiler project.

While many architectural ideas here remain foundational, this repository is no longer the active entry point.
