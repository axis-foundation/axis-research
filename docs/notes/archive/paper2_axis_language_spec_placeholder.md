# Paper 2: The Axis Core Language — Syntax, Types, and Semantics  
*Exploratory placeholder — subject to refinement through community and research collaboration.*

This paper will begin the process of formally describing the Axis core language. It will outline the intended structure of the syntax, type system, and deterministic evaluation model, along with an initial proposal for the memory semantics of Axis. All material here is early-stage and exploratory; it is meant to anchor discussion rather than prescribe a final design. The complete formalisation of the Axis language will emerge iteratively through feedback, critique, and collaboration with researchers and practitioners.
