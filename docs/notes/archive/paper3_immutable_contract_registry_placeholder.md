# Paper 3: The Axis Immutable Contract Registry  
*Exploratory placeholder — evolving through academic and community input.*

This paper will explore a proposed model for the Axis global function registry: a permanent, versioned catalogue of semantic contracts designed to provide stability and reproducibility for AI-generated computation. The ideas presented will be provisional and intended to stimulate discussion around structure, evolution rules, aliasing constraints, and cross-language consistency. A fully rigorous registry model will only emerge through iterative refinement in partnership with the research community.
