# Paper 5: Axis Web — Deterministic UI and Interaction Semantics  
*Exploratory placeholder — speculative direction for broader discussion.*

This paper will investigate how Axis concepts might extend into web semantics, including component structure, state flow, and deterministic UI behaviour. These ideas are preliminary and intended to provoke interdisciplinary dialogue about the feasibility of semantic UI frameworks based on Axis. The final scope and formal rules will depend heavily on community guidance and practical experimentation.
