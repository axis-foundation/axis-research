# Paper 6: Axis OS — Filesystem, Process, Permission, and Network Semantics  
*Exploratory placeholder — recognising that this area will require deep formal work.*

This paper will sketch early concepts for how Axis might model OS- and infrastructure-level semantics, including filesystems, processes, permissions, and network rules. These topics are highly complex and require collaboration with systems researchers, formal methods experts, and practitioners. The ideas here are meant as starting points toward a long-term vision of deterministic infrastructure semantics.
