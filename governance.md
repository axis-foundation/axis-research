Axis Governance Philosophy (Draft)

Axis is a research-first project exploring AI-native semantics. 
The core language, registry rules, and bridging semantics will always prioritise:

1. Determinism
2. Simplicity
3. Clarity
4. Formal rigor
5. Long-term stability

Contributions are welcome, but changes to the core semantics require:
- formal justification
- alignment with long-term principles
- architectural coherence

Axis is led by its founder (Chris Taylor) acting as Chief Architect and 
semantic decision-maker during the early research phase.
